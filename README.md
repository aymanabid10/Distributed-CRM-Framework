# Distributed CRM Framework

Welcome to the Distributed CRM Framework repository! This project implements a backend for a CRM application using three microservices, each with its own database and developed in different languages. The project explores two integration approaches: Istio-based communication and Dapr building blocks.

## Branches

This repository contains two main branches, each showcasing a different integration approach:

- **istio**: This branch demonstrates the usage of Istio for service mesh integration. Istio provides advanced traffic management, observability, and security for microservices.

- **dapr**: This branch demonstrates the usage of Dapr building blocks for service-to-service communication, state management, and pub/sub messaging. Dapr simplifies the development of microservices by providing a set of building blocks for common patterns.
